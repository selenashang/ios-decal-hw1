//: ## Q1: Optionals
//: The compiler is yelling at us. Why isn't this the correct way to unwrap optionals?

class Foo {
    
    var wordA : String!
    var wordB : String!
    
    init (words: [String?]) {
        wordA = words[0]
        wordB = words[1]
    
    
    }
//: In the input for init, words is already specified to be an optional, so we don't have to say that wordA and wordB are optionals, since they are going to take on the value of the 0th and 1st index of words. Side note: we declared wordA and wordB using an "!", wordA and wordB are implicitly unwrapped. The "!" gives the variable a value if it exists and a runtime error if it is nil and makes it known that there will always be a value for wordA and wordB.
    
//: ## Q2: Variable Types and Function Types
//: Why does the compiler dislike the for loop? Also, what should we return?
    
    class func arePalindromes(words: [String]) -> Bool! {
        let reversedWords = words.map() {String($0.characters.reverse())}
        let numElements = words.count
        
        for var i = 0; i < numElements; i++ {
            if words[i] != reversedWords[i] {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        return true
    }

//:"let" should be "var" because var allows the value to be changed. We should return a boolean not nil.
    
    
//: ## Q3: More functions, and object initialization
//: The method should be returning true or false -- what's wrong?
//: Are we initializing the dictionary correctly?
    class func isAnagram(wordA: String, wordB: String) -> Bool? {
        var countLetters = [Character : Int]()
        var lenA = wordA.characters.count
        var lenB = wordB.characters.count
        
        if lenA != lenB {
            return false
        }
        var arrA = Array(wordA.characters)
        var arrB = Array(wordB.characters)

        
        for i in 0...lenA-1 {
            let letter = arrA[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] {
                countLetters[letter] = val + 1
            } else {
                countLetters[letter] = 1
            }
        }
        
        for i in 0...lenB-1 {
            let letter = arrB[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] {
                countLetters[letter] = val - 1
            } else {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        for (letter, count) in countLetters {
            if count != 0 {
                return false

//: I added the word "class" in front of the word "func" so that the functions would be attributed to the Foo class. Also, the dictionary's initialization statement had the wrong syntax. Change the ":" to the "=" and add parentheses at the end.

//: **Do not** change anything below.
//: You should be able to call the methods as is.
